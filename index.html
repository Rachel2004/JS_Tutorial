            JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website.
            This happens in games, in the behaviour of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms;
            with dynamic styling; animation, etc.
            This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.

        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        JavaScript (js) is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on
        websites when applied to an HTML document.
        It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
        Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers.
        With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every
        time.
        The traditional website uses js to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.<br>
        <br>
        Although, JavaScript has no connectivity with Java programming language.
        The name was suggested and provided the times when Java was gaining popularity in the market.
        In addition to web browsers, databases such as CouchDB and MongoDB uses JavaScript as their scripting and query
        language.
        JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.
        JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language.
        The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the
        web browser.

        <h2>Features of JavaScript</h2>
        These are the following features of JavaScript:
        <ul>
            <li>All popular web browsers support JavaScript as they provide built-in execution environments.</li>
            <li>JavaScript follows the syntax and structure of the C programming language. Thus, it is a structured
                programming language.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where certain types are implicitly cast (depending on the
                operation).</li>
            <li>JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language that uses prototypes rather than using classes for
                inheritance.</li>
            <li>It is a case-sensitive language.</li>
            <li>JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.</li>
            <li>It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.</li>
            <li>It is a light-weighted and interpreted language.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Application of JavaScript</h2>
        JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:
        <ol>
            <li>Client-side validation</li>
            <li>Dynamic drop-down menus</li>
            <li>Displaying date and time</li>
            <li>Displaying pop-up windows and dialogue boxes (like an alert dialogue box, confirm dialogue box and
                prompt
                dialog box)</li>
            <li>Displaying clocks etc.</li>
